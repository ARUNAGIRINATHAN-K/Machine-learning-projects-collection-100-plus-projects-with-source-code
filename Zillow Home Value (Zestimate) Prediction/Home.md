# Zillow Home Value (Zestimate) Prediction in ML

House price index calculator which revolutionized the whole real estate industry in the US. 
This will be a regression task in which we have been provided with logarithm differences 
between the actual and the predicted prices of those homes by using a benchmark model.

## Importing Libraries and Dataset

Python libraries make it easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

- **Pandas** - This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
- **Numpy** - Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - This library is used to draw visualizations.
- **Sklearn** - This module contains multiple libraries are having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
- **XGBoost** - This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.

## Importing Libraries and Dataset

Python libraries make it easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

- Pandas - This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
- Numpy - Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - This library is used to draw visualizations.

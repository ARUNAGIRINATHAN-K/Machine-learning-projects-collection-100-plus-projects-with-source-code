# Predicting Stock Price Direction using Support Vector Machines

Predicting stock price direction is a key goal for traders and analysts. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that can help classify whether a stock's price will rise or fall. In this article, we'll demonstrate how to apply SVM to predict stock price movements using historical data, covering data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
